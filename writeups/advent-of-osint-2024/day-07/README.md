## Task

Did you know there's an Earth Day flag? Surprisingly, the image that appears on this flag is world-famous; however, the photographer's identity remains uncertain.  
A man decided, as a personal challenge, to find an answer to this question and created a website dedicated to this research.  
The identity of the photographer is unverifiable? I decided to take that as a personal challenge.
When was the last revision of his website (YYYYMMDD format)?  
Answer format : 20220816  

## Solution

1. Looking tor the [Blue Marble](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/elegantfigures/2011/10/06/crafting-the-blue-marble/) you find nothing new. Breaking point is looking for ["The identity of the photographer is unverifiable? I decided to take that as a personal challenge."](http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum29/HTML/000700.html) as it leads to the interesting forum.

1. There is a link in the first post leading to the website that is no longer available but you check it using [WaybackMachine](https://web.archive.org/web/20170801000000*/http://www.ehartwell.com/Apollo17/).  
2. There is a date of the last update at the top.

<details><summary>Question 1</summary>It was on April 25, 2007, ie,  20070425. EDIT 03:05 PM: on another site it's  20070719. To support his theory, Eric Hartwell relies on the radio exchanges of the astronauts. When it was too late to take more photographs, Ronald mentioned the value displayed on the camera's image counter. How many photos were taken? Answer format : 284</details>

<details><summary>Answer 2</summary>There is a dialog on the page. The counter indicated 123, so 122 photos were taken.</details>
